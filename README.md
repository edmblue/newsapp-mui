### ðŸ“‘ End note 

First time that I am using this API and I was sad to know that I won't be able to show a live preview of the website as I always do cause they don't allow to use the APIKey for free in production (too good to be true), anyways, it was great to build something with MaterialUI, since is a library that I have heard a lot, I was tempted to not practice it and go with TailwindCSS, but it's always great to learn new things and it's amazing how easy it makes to build a website with it.

<sub>**Additional**: There is no preview because of the restriction that the API have, however, [here is the link to the preview without any response](https://newsapp-rb.netlify.app/), if you check the console you'll see that the petition is correctly made but it's not showing anything on the front end</sub>
